## Hi, I'm SofÃ­a Tintos ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Computer Science student** exploring the world of technology and creativity.  
Iâ€™m still figuring out what I enjoy the most, but Iâ€™m especially curious about **software development** and how ideas can become real through code.

- ðŸ”­ I love **learning new things** and experimenting.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Python** and **SQL**.
- ðŸŽ¨ I enjoy mixing **technology** with **creativity** â€” building, designing, and exploring new concepts.
- ðŸ‘¯ I have a lot of hobbies, but I enjoy most photography and watching movies.
